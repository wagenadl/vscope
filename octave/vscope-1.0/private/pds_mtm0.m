% PDS_MTM0 - Multi-taper spectral estimate
%    This is DW's adaptation of Adam Taylor's PDS_MTM code
%    [ff,Pxx,Pxxs] = PDS_MTM0(tt,xx,fres) calculates one-side multi-taper
%    spectrogram.
%
%      TT [Tx1] indicates time points.
%      XX [TxN] is the (optical) data.
%      RES_FFT [1x1] is the half-width of the transform of the tapers used;
%                    It must be in reciprocal units of those of TT.
%
%      FF [Fx1] is the resulting (one-sided) frequency base.
%      Pxx [FxN] are the spectral estimates for the data XX at frequencies FF.
%      Pxxs [FxNxK] optionally returns the data for each taper individually.
%
%    Note that the nature of the beast is that the output Pxx has a 
%    full width of 2*FRES even if the signal XX is perfectly sinusoidal.

% From Adam's comments:
% t is a col vector
% elements of t are evenly spaced and increasing
% x is a real matrix with the same number of rows as t
% f_res is the half-width of the transform of the tapers used
%   it must be in reciprocal units of those of t
% N_fft is the length to which data is zero-padded before FFTing
% this works on the columns of x independently
%
% f is the frequncy base, which is one-sided
% Pxx's cols are the the one-sided spectral estimates of the cols of x
% Pxxs is 3D, (frequency samples)x(cols of x)x(tapers), gives the spectrum
%   estimate for each taper

% we assume that x is real, and return the one-side periodogram
