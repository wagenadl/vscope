Normal data acquisition is timed as follows in my setup:

- AI is triggered by software
- AO is triggered by AI's start (i.e. ai/StartTrigger -> ao/StartTrigger)
- DI sampling is timed from AI sampling (i.e. ai/SampleClock -> di/SampleClock)
- DO sampling is timed from AO sampling (i.e. ao/SampleClock -> do/SampleClock)

9/11/08: I don't think that's true. The way I programmed analogout, ao is
timed from ai's sample clock, not triggered from ai's start.
