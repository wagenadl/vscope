vscope 1.0.0-rc1

  Preparing VScope for first public release.
  Triggering now does work with Evolve as well as QuantEM. The previous problem
  was not in VScope but rather in the Firewire driver. Photometrics cameras
  only work with the "Thesycon" drivers provided with the PVCam package.

vscope 0.99.4

  Still not ready for primetime, since triggering doesn't yet work on Evolve.
  However, both trigger modes work fine on QuantEM, and continuous acq (focus)
  works on Evolve.
