vscope 1.0.2

  Various updates and bugfixes

      The set of input channels can now be made empty. But trials cannot be acquired in that situation.
      Focus now disabled if no cameras defined
      Single Frame now grayed out if no cameras
      Simplified default connections file
      Added "schmitt.m" to octave code so vscope_load can actually work without wagenaarlab code
      vscope_stacktrial creates a synthetic snapshot trial from a focus stack of real snapshot trials

vscope 1.0.0~rc1

  Preparing VScope for first public release.
  Triggering now does work with Evolve as well as QuantEM. The previous problem
  was not in VScope but rather in the Firewire driver. Photometrics cameras
  only work with the "Thesycon" drivers provided with the PVCam package.

vscope 0.99.4

  Still not ready for primetime, since triggering doesn't yet work on Evolve.
  However, both trigger modes work fine on QuantEM, and continuous acq (focus)
  works on Evolve.
