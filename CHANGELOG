vscope 1.0.6

  Can now move all ROIs on a given camera at once.
  Created multitaper_psd and multitaper_coherence with saner confidence interval estimators. I never understood Adam Taylorâ€™s estimates.
  vscope_psd.m now returns uncertainties as well
  getopt now uses strsplit
  Added getopt

vscope 1.0.4

  guipage no longer adds toplevel objects to topgroup. I do not know what that mechanism was for, but it made "Dummy" and "Cont ephys" compete with each other and with "Auto run".
  trivial fixes to imagestack and stacktrial
  Version confusion about cohplotsignals and cohplotimage. Split off /xps/ version with "-x" suffix. I think that was not the version to use, but I am not sure.
  HighDpiScaling disabled before 5.6.1

vscope 1.0.2

  Various updates and bugfixes

      The set of input channels can now be made empty. But trials cannot be acquired in that situation.
      Focus now disabled if no cameras defined
      Single Frame now grayed out if no cameras
      Simplified default connections file
      Added "schmitt.m" to octave code so vscope_load can actually work without wagenaarlab code
      vscope_stacktrial creates a synthetic snapshot trial from a focus stack of real snapshot trials

vscope 1.0.0~rc4

  Major bugfixes to Windows version:
  - mkdpss is now included with distribution, so coherence works

vscope 1.0.0~rc1

  Preparing VScope for first public release.
  Triggering now does work with Evolve as well as QuantEM. The previous problem
  was not in VScope but rather in the Firewire driver. Photometrics cameras
  only work with the "Thesycon" drivers provided with the PVCam package.

vscope 0.99.4

  Still not ready for primetime, since triggering doesn't yet work on Evolve.
  However, both trigger modes work fine on QuantEM, and continuous acq (focus)
  works on Evolve.
