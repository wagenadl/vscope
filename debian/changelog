      Single Frame now grayed out if no cameras
      Simplified default connections file
      Added "schmitt.m" to octave code so vscope_load can actually work without wagenaarlab code

vscope (1.0.0~rc1-1) yakkety; urgency=medium

  Preparing VScope for first public release.
  Triggering now does work with Evolve as well as QuantEM. The previous problem
  was not in VScope but rather in the Firewire driver. Photometrics cameras
  only work with the "Thesycon" drivers provided with the PVCam package.

vscope (0.99.4-1) yakkety; urgency=medium

  Still not ready for primetime, since triggering doesn't yet work on Evolve.
  However, both trigger modes work fine on QuantEM, and continuous acq (focus)
  works on Evolve.
